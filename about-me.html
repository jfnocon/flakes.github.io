									<p>
                                        Greetings, lovely readers! Allow me to introduce myself,
										I go by the name Flakes, although my friends often affectionately refer to me as Ju, Juju, or Juls.
										I'm driven by an ambitious spirit and have set my sights on a diverse array of aspirations: 
										from becoming a skilled game developer, a meticulous tester, and a creative infrastructure designer,
										to delving into the world of UI/UX design. On top of that, I have a passion for dance that I nurture 
										as a Dance Artist, and I dabble in the art of being a Disk Jockey and a Radio Jockey. Athletics also 
										hold a special place in my heart, with basketball being a favorite pastime. Beyond that, I've even 
										harbored dreams of donning the hat of a Fireman, serving in the Army, and achieving the esteemed title of 
										Scout Ranger and Boxer. All while hoping I successfully complete a dual degree.
                                    </p>

									<p>
                                        Having spent my formative years in the vibrant landscape of the Philippines, I've had my fair share of 
										both highs and lows. After all, isn't the tapestry of life woven with such experiences? I hold a genuine 
										appreciation for the people and things that have graced my journey. My social circles are diverse, woven 
										from the threads of numerous friendships and connections. These relationships have introduced me to a myriad of 
										personalities, both locally and abroad, as my thirst for exploration has led me to travel far and wide. 
										In these adventures, I've celebrated triumphant victories, but I've also encountered my share of defeats. 
										Particularly among those who hold a special place in my heart.
                                    </p>

									<p>
										I've taken the liberty to create this website not only as a digital representation of myself, but also as a means 
										for those who may be curious about my life to catch a glimpse. A humorous note: you might even call it a virtual 
										"stalking" opportunity, though all in good fun! As of now, I find myself at a crossroads, having bid adieu to my 
										previous employment. The driving force behind this decision is my aspiration to migrate and pursue fresh career 
										avenues in new horizons. Your well wishes and positive vibes are most welcome as I embark on this exciting journey.
									</p>

									<p>
										In this present moment, my focus is steadfast on self-improvement. I am on a quest to become the best version of myself, 
										not just for my own benefit, but to stand as a shining example that others may look up to. Thank you for joining me on 
										this remarkable chapter of growth and discovery. Together, let's embrace the boundless opportunities that lie ahead!
									</p>
